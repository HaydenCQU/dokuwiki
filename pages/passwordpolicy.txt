==== The CQUNIX password policy ==== 

CQUnix has a basic password policy. This being that the user is required to have a password and the password must meet specific requirements. If the password doesn’t meet the said requirements an error message will be shown. The requirements are like so:

The length of the password must be at least 8 characters long\\
The password cannot be a password the user has previously used\\
The password will expire every 100 days, and will force the user to change the password\\
The user shouldn’t use the same password at work that they do at home, for example, the user shouldn’t use their Netflix account password for their work password\\
The password should be totally unique and different from other work-related passwords\\
The user shouldn’t use a password that resembles their name, username or email\\

This policy is implemented by each server through the use of password rules. These rules and policies are required so that the user accounts aren’t susceptible to attackers. These policies and rules also ensure that if an attacker gains access to an employee's or contractor's account, the employee/contractor is not able to log in to different company accounts.
